Introduction
Why use QuickZone?
The Physics Bottleneck. Traditional zone libraries act as wrappers for Roblox's physics engine (e.g., GetPartsInPart or .Touched), binding spatial logic to collision meshes. This results in expensive geometry calculations, unpredictable overhead, low flexibility, and much worse performance as the number of zones grows.

Clean Architecture. QuickZone takes a different approach. By separating what you track (Groups), where you track them (Zones), and how you respond (Observers), it eliminates monolithic, instance-bound logic and keeps your codebase clean.

Physics-Free Scaling. QuickZone achieves O(N log Z) scaling by bypassing the physics engine in favor of pure geometric math and a custom Linear Bounding Volume Hierarchy (LBVH). Performance is driven by the number of entities, while the map size is virtually irrelevant.

Unopinionated API. Whether you prefer classic event-driven programming, robust lifecycle management (observe()), or zero-allocation polling for ECS architectures, QuickZone can fit your workflow.

Total Performance Control. The runtime cost is entirely in your control. Through a budgeted scheduler, the workload is smeared across frames and only consumes as much CPU time as you explicitly allow. Paired with contiguous arrays that produce virtually zero garbage collection (GC) pressure, QuickZone produces a flat, predictable performance profile.

Point-Based Detection
QuickZone uses point-based detection. It checks if a specific point (e.g., the center of a Part, the position of an Attachment, or the Pivot of a Model) is inside a zone's boundary.

Core Features
Endless Scale: The number of zones has zero impact on performance. Maintain 60 FPS even with over a million zones in your game.

Track Anything: Track BaseParts, Models, Attachments, Bones, Cameras, or even custom tables. If it has a position, QuickZone can track it.

Budgeted Scheduler: Set a hard frame budget (e.g., 1ms) to completely eliminate lag spikes. Workloads are smeared across frames to maintain a flat, predictable performance profile.

Shape Support: Support for Blocks, Balls, Cylinders, Wedges and CornerWedges without relying on physics collision meshes.

Lifecycle Management: Use the observe pattern for 100% reliable cleanup. Say goodbye to juggling onEnter and onExit events (though classic event-driven programming is still supported).

ECS & Data-Oriented: Built-in support for zero-allocation iterators and deterministic manual stepping, making it a perfect fit for ECS architectures.

Decoupled Architecture: Separate game logic from spatial instances. Bind behaviors directly to categories of entities (Players, NPCs, Projectiles) for a clean, scalable codebase.

Zero-Allocation Runtime: By utilizing contiguous arrays and object pooling, QuickZone produces close to zero GC pressure, avoiding memory-related stutters.

No Dependencies: QuickZone is a standalone, lightweight library that does not rely on any other external packages.

Performance Benchmarks
QuickZone was benchmarked against the most popular alternatives in two distinct scenarios: Map Stress (lots of zones) and Entity Stress (lots of moving parts).

Note: For the QuickZone benchmark, we used a frame budget of 1ms, the entities' update rate was set to 60Hz, and precision was 0.0.

Test 1: High Zone Count
Scenario: 500 moving entities, 10,000 zones, recorded over 30 seconds.

This test highlights the fundamental flaw in traditional Zone-Centric libraries. As map complexity grows, their performance degrades exponentially.

Metric QuickZone ZonePlus SimpleZone QuickBounds Empty Script
FPS 59.25 3.84 5.53 58.95 59.28
Events/s 643 627 519 328 0
Memory Usage (MB) 18.57 4230 99.79 17.62 0.65
The Result: QuickZone maintained a perfect 60 FPS.

ZonePlus and SimpleZone imploded, dropping to 3-5 FPS, making the game unplayable.
ZonePlus consumed over 4 GB of memory, which would crash most mobile devices instantly.
QuickZone proved its O(N log Z) algorithmic advantage.
QuickZone vs. QuickBounds: Both libraries scaled well by maintaining ~60 FPS. However, QuickZone still maintained a slight FPS lead and, more importantly, delivered double the event throughput (643 vs 328) compared to QuickBounds.
Test 2: High Entity Count
Scenario: 2,000 moving entities, 100 zones, recorded over 30 seconds.

FPS 42.37 29.88 37.23 41.31 42.73
Events/s 2271 2482 2518 566 0
Memory Usage (MB) 2.13 159 1.77 2.60 1.04
The Result: QuickZone is the only library that maintained near-baseline FPS (-1% impact).

ZonePlus caused a 28% drop in framerate.
QuickZone handled the load with 98% less memory than ZonePlus.
QuickZone vs. QuickBounds: QuickZone squeezes out more performance, averaging ~1 FPS higher than QuickBounds. More importantly, QuickZone processed 4x the volume of events (2,271 vs 566).

Quick Start
The following example showcases an anti-gravity system. QuickZone supports three coding styles, so choose the one that fits your architecture.

Option A: The Lifecycle Approach (Recommended)
Best for clean, modern code. You define relationships in a configuration table (Declarative) and use a single function to manage the active state (Lifecycle).

local QuickZone = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.QuickZone)
local Zone, Group, Observer = QuickZone.Zone, QuickZone.Group, QuickZone.Observer

-- Create a group that automatically tracks the client's character (including respawns)
local myPlayer = Group.localPlayer()

-- Find all current and future instances with the 'Water' tag.
local zones = Zone.fromTag('AntiGravity', {
metadata = { GravityMultiplier = 0.4 }
})

-- Create an observer subscribed to the group and attached to the zones.
local gravityObserver = Observer.new({
groups = { myPlayer },
zones = { zones }
})

-- Define behavior
gravityObserver:observe(function(player, zone)
local character = player.Character
local hrp = character and character:FindFirstChild('HumanoidRootPart')
if not hrp then return end

    -- Get the zone's gravity multiplier using metadata.
    local meta = zone:getMetadata()
    local multiplier = meta and meta.GravityMultiplier or 1

    -- Create the Anti-Gravity force on enter
    local force = Instance.new('BodyForce')
    force.Name = 'AntiGravityForce'
    force.Force = Vector3.new(0, hrp.AssemblyMass * workspace.Gravity * (1- multiplier), 0)
    force.Parent = hrp

    -- Automatically destroy the force when the player exits the zone
    return function()
        force:Destroy()
    end

end)

Option B: The Event-Driven Approach (ZonePlus / SimpleZone Style)
Best for familiarity or for migrating ZonePlus code to QuickZone. You manually 'wire' objects together (Imperative) and use standard events like onEnter to trigger one-off actions (Event-Driven).

local QuickZone = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.QuickZone)
local Zone, Group, Observer = QuickZone.Zone, QuickZone.Group, QuickZone.Observer
local localPlayer = game:GetService('Players').LocalPlayer

local myPlayer = Group.localPlayer()
local zones = Zone.fromChildren(workspace.AntiGravityParts)
local gravityObserver = Observer.new():subscribe(myPlayer):attach(zones)

-- Connect events
gravityObserver:onLocalPlayerEnter(function(zone)
local character = localPlayer.Character
local hrp = character and character:FindFirstChild('HumanoidRootPart')
if not hrp then return end

    local ref = zone:getReference() -- This returns the zone's part
    local multiplier = ref and ref:GetAttribute("GravityMultiplier") or 1 -- You can use attributes!

    local force = Instance.new('BodyForce')
    force.Name = 'AntiGravityForce'
    force.Force = Vector3.new(0, hrp.AssemblyMass * workspace.Gravity * (1- multiplier), 0)
    force.Parent = hrp

end)

gravityObserver:onLocalPlayerExit(function(zone)
local character = localPlayer.Character
local hrp = character and character:FindFirstChild('HumanoidRootPart')

    if hrp and hrp:FindFirstChild('AntiGravityForce') then
        hrp.AntiGravityForce:Destroy()
    end

end)

Option C: The Polling Approach (Data-Oriented / ECS)
Use iterators to poll state for continuous logic. To enhance ECS workflows, you can also turn off auto-updating and update QuickZone manually. It is even possible to manually link entities to a reference like an Id or an object.

local Players = game:GetService('Players')
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
local QuickZone = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.QuickZone)
local Zone, Group, Observer = QuickZone.Zone, QuickZone.Group, QuickZone.Observer

-- Disable auto-update for deterministic, manual stepping (optional)
QuickZone:setEnabled(false)

local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
local characterModel = localPlayer.Character or localPlayer.CharacterAdded:Wait()

-- Track this Model's physical position, but return the local player in queries
QuickZone:setReference(characterModel, localPlayer)

-- Add the local player to the spatial group (QuickZone tracks the mapped model automatically)
local playerGroup = Group.new():add(localPlayer)
local zones = Zone.fromTag('AntiGravity', {
metadata = { GravityMultiplier = 0.4 }
})
local gravityObserver = Observer.new({
groups = { playerGroup },
zones = { zones }
})

-- Process all spatial movement and LBVH tree updates in a specific order (only needed if :setEnabled(false))
local function spatialSystem(dt)
QuickZone:update(dt)
end

local function gravitySystem(dt)
-- Instead of creating a BodyForce, we apply continuous math statelessly.
for player, zone in gravityObserver:iterEntitiesInside() do
local character = player.Character
local hrp = character and character:FindFirstChild('HumanoidRootPart')
if not hrp then continue end

        local meta = zone:getMetadata()
        local multiplier = meta and meta.GravityMultiplier or 1

        local upwardForce = hrp.AssemblyMass * workspace.Gravity * (1- multiplier)
        hrp:ApplyImpulse(Vector3.new(0, upwardForce * dt, 0))
    end

end

RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(dt)
spatialSystem(dt)
gravitySystem(dt)
end)
