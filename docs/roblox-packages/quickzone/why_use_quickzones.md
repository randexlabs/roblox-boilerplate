Why use QuickZone?
Traditional zone libraries like ZonePlus and SimpleZone act as wrappers for Roblox's physics engine (e.g., GetBoundsInBox, GetPartsInPart or .Touched), resulting in expensive collision geometry calculations and synchronization overhead.

QuickZone bypasses the physics engine in favor of geometric math and data-oriented design. It implements a Linear BVH (LBVH) that resolves spatial queries using highly optimized VM bytecode to eliminate overhead.

1. The Entity-Centric Model
   Traditional libraries are Zone-Centric. They iterate through every Zone instance and query the physics engine for overlapping parts (i.e. entities in QuickZone-terms).

The Scaling Problem: Performance worsens as you add more zones (O(Z)), even if the number of entities remains static.
QuickZone, on the other hand, is Entity-Centric. It keeps a list of entities and queries them against an LBVH (O(N log Z)).

The Benefit: This means that you can have hundreds, even thousands, of zones with close to zero runtime cost. The cost effectively becomes a factor of the number of entities that are being processed. 2. Expressive and Boilerplate-Free API
Writing performant code shouldn't mean writing complicated code. QuickZone is designed to be highly ergonomic.

CollectionService Integration: Tag your parts and bind them to your logic in a single line of code (e.g., Zone.fromTag('Lava')).

Declarative Configurations: QuickZone lets you define behaviors, priorities, and relationships upfront in simple configuration tables, drastically reducing boilerplate and keeping your scripts clean.

Lifecycle Cleanups: The .observe() pattern brings modern state management to spatial tracking. Return a function when a player enters, and it runs automatically when they exit.

3. Data-Oriented Design (DOD)
   Most Roblox libraries rely heavily on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). QuickZone is built entirely around Data-Oriented Design, prioritizing how the CPU actually reads memory.

Contiguous Memory: QuickZone stores its LBVH and entity data in pre-allocated, flat arrays. This completely eliminates slow pointer-chasing and guarantees maximum CPU cache locality.

Bitwise Spatial Sorting: To effectively map 3D space into these flat 1D arrays, QuickZone utilizes Morton Codes (Z-Order Curves). By transforming 3D coordinates into integers via highly optimized bitwise operations, spatial queries become instant array lookups.

Zero GC Pressure: Because QuickZone relies on stable arrays and aggressive object pooling, it generates practically zero garbage during runtime. This completely eliminates the micro-stutters typically caused by Luau's Garbage Collector cleaning up old tables.

Iterators: QuickZone provides zero-allocation generators like iterEntitiesInside(). Because these iterators allocate no new memory, QuickZone is a perfect library for Entity Component System (ECS) workflows.

4. Architecture
   QuickZone moves away from monolithic, instance-bound logic in favor of a Group-Observer-Zone topology. This architecture separates what is being tracked from where the tracking occurs and how the system should respond.

Priority

Groups
A Group is a collection of entities that share logical categorization. An entity can be part of multiple groups at the same time.

Observers
Observers act as the logic bridge. They subscribe to Groups and are attached to Zones, creating a many-to-many relationship that keeps game logic decoupled and clean. Performance can be configured per Observer, like setting the update rate in Hz or the precision, i.e. the minimum distance threshold to perform a spatial query, in studs. This prevents wasting CPU cycles checking a slow-moving NPC, for example.

Because Observers are decoupled from the physics engine, they can aggregate spatial data. Tracking an entire Group costs no additional spatial queries. And using observeGroup(), an Observer can fire an event when the first member of a Group enters a zone, and clean up when the last member leaves.

5. The Budgeted Scheduler
   A common issue with spatial libraries is stutter due to it processing too many things in one frame. QuickZone fixes this via its smart Scheduler.

Frame Budgeting
You can set a hard time limit (e.g., 1ms). The Scheduler monitors os.clock() in real-time. If the budget is met, the system pauses immediately and resumes in the next frame. This guarantees that QuickZone will never be the cause of a frame drop.

Workload Smearing
The scheduler smears updates across frames. This means that, if you have a Group of 600 entities updating at 10Hz, QuickZone will process exactly 100 entities per frame at 60 fps. This ensures that we have flat, predictable performance profile with no peaks or valleys.

No starvation
The Scheduler uses a Round-Robin strategy for Group processing. Instead of processing groups in order, QuickZone cycles through them fairly. This prevents the issue where a heavy group keeps consuming the entire frame budget and 'starving' the subsequent groups.

6. Dual-LBVH and Batched Rebuilding
   To maintain high performance, QuickZone maintains two LBVHs:

The Static LBVH: Contains all non-moving, non-resizing zones.

The Dynamic LBVH: Contains zones attached to moving parts (e.g., vehicles, platforms).

Optimization via Batching
Rebuilding an LBVH is computationally expensive. QuickZone optimizes this by batching updates per frame: if multiple zones are added, removed, or moved in a single frame, QuickZone will only perform a single rebuild at the start of the Scheduler step.

By separating static and dynamic zones, QuickZone minimizes the workload of the LBVH rebuilder. Rebuilding a small tree of 5 moving platforms is significantly faster than rebuilding a tree containing 500 static buildings.

Frame budget
Rebuilding the LBVHs is part of the frame budget. Thus, rebuilding will result in less time for processing the groups of entities.

7. Flexibility
   Because QuickZone relies on pure math rather than the Physics engine, it is not limited to BaseParts. It also supports duck typing for entities.

BaseParts: Uses .Position.

Models: Uses .PrimaryPart.Position or :GetPivot() (if .PrimaryPart does not exist).

Attachments/Bones: Uses .WorldPosition.

Cameras: Uses .CFrame.Position.

Tables: Uses any custom .Position, .WorldPosition and .CFrame field, or :GetPivot().

This allows you to track real-time simulations (e.g. a spell cast or an RC car) without the overhead of creating physical Instances.

8. Performance Benchmarks
   We stress-tested QuickZone against the most popular alternatives in two distinct scenarios: Entity Stress (lots of moving parts) and Map Stress (lots of zones).

Note: For the QuickZone benchmark, we used a frame budget of 1ms, the entities' update rate was set to 60Hz, and precision was 0.0.

Test 1: High Zone Count
Scenario: 500 moving entities, 10,000 zones, recorded over 30 seconds.

This test highlights the fundamental flaw in traditional Zone-Centric libraries. As map complexity grows, their performance degrades exponentially.
