# Self-Hosting And Registry Policy

Self-hosted registry setup, index configuration, auth and storage options, plus official policy constraints for registry content and ownership.

## Self Hosting Registries

- Source: `docs/src/content/docs/guides/self-hosting-registries.mdx`
- Original description: Learn how to self host registries for pesde.

You can self host registries for pesde. This is useful if you want a private
registry or if you a separate registry for other reasons.

## Making the index repository

The index is a repository that contains metadata about all the packages in the
registry.

An index contains a `config.toml` file with configuration options.

To create an index, create a new repository and add a `config.toml` file with
the following content:

```toml title="config.toml"
# the URL of the registry API
api = "https://registry.acme.local/"

# package download URL (optional)
download = "{API_URL}/v1/packages/{PACKAGE}/{PACKAGE_VERSION}/{PACKAGE_TARGET}/archive"

# the client ID of the GitHub OAuth app (optional)
github_oauth_client_id = "a1d648966fdfbdcd9295"

# whether to allow packages with Git dependencies (default: false)
git_allowed = true

# whether to allow packages which depend on packages from other registries
# (default: false)
other_registries_allowed = ["https://git.acme.local/index"]

# whether to allow packages with Wally dependencies (default: false)
wally_allowed = false

# the maximum size of the archive in bytes (default: 4MB)
max_archive_size = 4194304

# the scripts packages present in the `init` command selection by default
scripts_packages = ["pesde/scripts_rojo"]
```

- **api**: The URL of the registry API. See below for more information.

- **download**: The URL to download packages from. This is optional and
  defaults to the correct URL for the official pesde registry implementation.
  You only need this if you are using a custom registry implementation.

    This string can contain the following placeholders:
    - `{API_URL}`: The API URL (as specified in the `api` field).
    - `{PACKAGE}`: The package name.
    - `{PACKAGE_VERSION}`: The package version.
    - `{PACKAGE_TARGET}`: The package target.

    Defaults to `{API_URL}/v1/packages/{PACKAGE}/{PACKAGE_VERSION}/{PACKAGE_TARGET}/archive`.

- **github_oauth_client_id**: This is required if you use GitHub OAuth for
  authentication. See below for more information.

- **git_allowed**: Whether to allow packages with Git dependencies. This can be
  either a bool or a list of allowed repository URLs. This is optional and
  defaults to `false`.

- **other_registries_allowed**: Whether to allow packages which depend on
  packages from other registries. This can be either a bool or a list of
  allowed index repository URLs. This is optional and defaults to `false`.

- **wally_allowed**: Whether to allow packages with Wally dependencies. This can
  be either a bool or a list of allowed index repository URLs. This is
  optional and defaults to `false`.

- **max_archive_size**: The maximum size of the archive in bytes. This is
  optional and defaults to `4194304` (4MB).

- **scripts_packages**: The scripts packages present in the `init` command
  selection by default. This is optional and defaults to none.

You should then push this repository to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Configuring the registry

The registry is a web server that provides package downloads and the ability to
publish packages.

The official registry implementation is available in the
[pesde GitHub repository](https://github.com/pesde-pkg/pesde/tree/0.5/registry).

Configuring the registry is done using environment variables. In order to allow
the registry to access the index repository, you must use an account that
has access to the index repository. We recommend using a separate account
for this purpose.

> [!NOTE]
> For a GitHub account the password **must** be a personal access token. For instructions on how to
> create a personal access token, see the [GitHub
> documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
> The access token must have read and write access to the index repository.

### General configuration

- **INDEX_REPO_URL**: The URL of the index repository. This is required.\
  Example: `https://github.com/pesde-pkg/index.git`

- **GIT_USERNAME**: The username of a Git account that has push access to the
  index repository. This is required.

- **GIT_PASSWORD**: The password of the account specified by
  `GITHUB_USERNAME`. This is required.

- **COMMITTER_GIT_NAME**: The name to use for the committer when updating the
  index repository. This is required.\
  Example: `pesde index updater`

- **COMMITTER_GIT_EMAIL**: The email to use for the committer when updating the
  index repository. This is required.\
  Example: `pesde@localhost`

- **DATA_DIR**: The directory where the registry stores miscellaneous data.
  This value can use `{CWD}` to refer to the current working directory.\
  Default: `{CWD}/data`

- **ADDRESS**: The address to bind the server to.\
  Default: `127.0.0.1`

- **PORT**: The port to bind the server to.\
  Default: `8080`

### Authentication configuration

The registry supports multiple authentication methods, which are documented
below.

#### General configuration

- **READ_NEEDS_AUTH**: If set to any value, reading data requires
  authentication. If not set, anyone can read from the registry.
  This is optional.

#### Single token authentication

Allows read and write access to the registry using a single token.

- **ACCESS_TOKEN**: The token to use for authentication.

#### Multiple token authentication

Allows read and write access to the registry using different tokens.

- **READ_ACCESS_TOKEN**: The token that grants read access.
- **WRITE_ACCESS_TOKEN**: The token that grants write access.

#### GitHub OAuth authentication

Allows clients to get read and write access to the registry using GitHub OAuth.
This requires a GitHub OAuth app, instructions to create one can be found
in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

- **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET**: The client secret of the GitHub OAuth app.

#### No authentication

If none of the above variables are set, **anyone** will be able to read and
write to the registry.

### Storage configuration

The registry supports multiple storage backends, which are documented below.

#### File system storage

Stores packages on the file system.

- **FS_STORAGE_ROOT**: The root directory where packages are stored.

#### S3 storage

Stores packages on an S3 compatible storage service, such as
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or
[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/).

- **S3_ENDPOINT**: The endpoint of the S3 bucket to store packages in.
- **S3_BUCKET_NAME**: The name of the bucket.
- **S3_REGION**: The region of the bucket.
- **S3_ACCESS_KEY**: The access key to use.
- **S3_SECRET_KEY**: The secret key to use.

### Sentry configuration

The registry supports [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking.

- **SENTRY_DSN**: The DSN of the Sentry instance.

## Running the registry

First clone the repository and navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pesde-pkg/pesde.git
cd pesde
```

You can then build the registry using the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release -p pesde-registry
```

This will build the registry. The resulting binary will be located at
`target/release/pesde-registry` or `target/release/pesde-registry.exe`.

After setting the environment variables, you can run the registry using the
by executing the binary.

The registry must be exposed at the URL specified in the `api` field of the
index repository configuration.

## Policies

- Source: `docs/src/content/docs/registry/policies.md`
- Original description: Policies for the pesde registry

The following policies apply to the [official public pesde registry](https://registry.pesde.daimond113.com)
and its related services, such as the index repository or websites.
They may not apply to other registries. By using the pesde registry, you agree
to these policies.

If anything is unclear, please [contact us](#contact-us), and we will be happy
to help.

## Contact Us

You can contact us at [pesde@daimond113.com](mailto:pesde@daimond113.com). In
case of a security issue, please prefix the subject with `[SECURITY]`.

## Permitted content

The pesde registry is a place for Luau-related packages. This includes:

- Libraries
- Frameworks
- Tools

The following content is forbidden:

- Malicious, vulnerable code
- Illegal, harmful content
- Miscellaneous files (doesn't include configuration files, documentation, etc.)

pesde is not responsible for the content of packages, the scope owner is. It
is the responsibility of the scope owner to ensure that the content of their
packages is compliant with the permitted content policy.

If you believe a package is breaking these requirements, please [contact us](#contact-us).

## Package removal

pesde does not support removing packages for reasons such as abandonment. A
package may only be removed for the following reasons:

- The package is breaking the permitted content policy
- The package contains security vulnerabilities
- The package must be removed for legal reasons (e.g. DMCA takedown)

In case a secret has been published to the registry, it must be invalidated.
If you believe a package should be removed, please [contact us](#contact-us).
We will review your request and take action if necessary.

If we find that a package is breaking the permitted content policy, we will
exercise our right to remove it from the registry without notice.

pesde reserves the right to remove any package from the registry at any time for
any or no reason, without notice.

## Package ownership

Packages are owned by scopes. Scope ownership is determined by the first person
to publish a package to the scope. The owner of the scope may send a pull request
to the index repository adding team members' user IDs to the scope's `scope.toml`
file to give them access to the scope, however at least one package must be
published to the scope before this can be done. Each person added must confirm
being added. The owner may also remove team members from the scope.

A scope's true owner's ID must appear first in the `owners` field of the scope's
`scope.toml` file. Ownership may be transferred by the current owner sending a
pull request to the index repository, and the new owner confirming the transfer.

Only the owner may add or remove team members from the scope.

pesde reserves the right to override scope ownership in the case of a dispute,
such as if the original owner is unresponsive or multiple parties claim ownership.

## Scope squatting

Scope squatting is the act of creating a scope with the intent of preventing
others from using it, without any intention of using it yourself. This is
forbidden and can result in the removal (release) of the scope and its packages
from the registry without notice.

If you believe a scope is being squatted, please [contact us](#contact-us).
We will review your request and take action if necessary.

## API Usage

The pesde registry has an API for querying, downloading, and publishing packages.
Only non-malicious use is permitted. Malicious uses include:

- **Service Degradation**: this includes sending an excessive amount of requests
  to the registry in order to degrade the service
- **Exploitation**: this includes trying to break the security of the registry
  in order to gain unauthorized access
- **Harmful content**: this includes publishing harmful (non-law compliant,
  purposefully insecure) content
