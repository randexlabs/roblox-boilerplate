    - This is possible because luau-lsp started using the sourcemap for string
      requires

- The `init` alias has been reserved to avoid confusions with Luau's require
  module paths by @daimond113

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As pesde is currently in version 0.x, we can only guarantee security for:

- **The latest minor** (currently 0.7).
- **The latest release candidate for the next version**, if available.

When a new minor version is released, the previous version will immediately lose security support.

> **Note:** This policy will change with the release of version 1.0, which will include an extended support period for versions >=1.0.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.7   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage all security concerns to be reported at [pesde@daimond113.com](mailto:pesde@daimond113.com), along the following format:

- **Subject**: The subject must be prefixed with `[SECURITY]` to ensure it is prioritized as a security concern.
- **Content**:
    - **Affected Versions**: Clearly specify which are affected by the issue.
    - **Issue Details**: Provide a detailed description of the issue, including reproduction steps and/or a simple example, if applicable.

We will try to respond as soon as possible.
